# Unitary Matrix extension

A unitary matrix is a square matrix whose product with its conjugate transpose equals the identity matrix.
A normal matrix is a square matrix that commutes with its conjugate transpose.

The original SymPy Matrix class does not have `is_normal()` and `is_unitary()` methods, so let's add them.
